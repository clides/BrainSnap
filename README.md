# BrainSnap ‚Äî Turn lecture materials into micro-learning brain "nourishment" reels

**BrainSnap** converts dense study material (slides, PDFs, lecture notes, textbook chapters) into
short, vertical, meme-style reels with AI voice and auto-captions ‚Äî same format people already
consume for hours, but with study concepts instead of brain-rot.

## ‚ú® What BrainSnap does

1) **Upload** slides / textbook chapter (PDF, PPT, images)  
2) **AI rewrites and organizes** the content into 10‚Äì30s micro-lessons
3) **AI voiceover** narrates each micro-script  
4) **Meme background + captions** are auto-composited  
5) **Export** a list of reels to download or view on the webapp

**v0.3**
- Add quiz feature
- Add chatbot feature for live Q&A on lecture materials
- Spaced repetition from viewed reels

**v0.4**
- Improve reel generation quality by generating more reels for topics that the user have trouble on for the quiz
- User accounts & project history
- Credit / quota system for generation
- Classroom or team sharing mode
